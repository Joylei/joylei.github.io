I published my first nuget package at https://www.nuget.org/packages/NFly.BitsTransfer/1.0.0-alpha1

Although it took me some time to undnerstand how it works, it's an interesting expirence.

To get start publishing your own package, you can refer to these two articles:
 - [Creating and Publishing a Package](https://docs.nuget.org/create/creating-and-publishing-a-package)
 - [Multi targeting a single .Net project to build for different framework versions](http://shazwazza.com/post/multi-targeting-a-single-net-project-to-build-for-different-framework-versions/)

Hope this article can save you some time.
